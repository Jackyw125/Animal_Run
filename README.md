# Animal Run

## General Game Overview

Animal Run is an endless survival game that involves one character, a single monster and coins. The game-playing area is the entire screen. The game's objective is to get as high of a score as possible by collecting coins without colliding with any monsters. In Animal Run, the character automatically moves horizontally from left to right. Vertical movement is controlled by the player: pressing the spacebar makes the character jump (a short, upward burst followed by falling due to gravity), while holding the "W" key allows the character to fly (sustained upward movement counteracting gravity).  The game begins with the character starting on the left side of the screen. Coins and monsters are spawned with both of them being stationary. Only the vertical movement of the character is controlled. The game ends when the character collides with any of the monsters the option to play again or quit. The character will stay at a constant horizontal velocity when moving or flying but will change the horizontal velocity when jumping while the vertical velocity changes when falling, jumping or flying unless the character has landed or when the animal reaches the top of the screen then the vertical velocity will be zero. When the character reaches the right side of the screen and goes “off” the screen, it will appear on the left side. The game's boundary is the screen's top and the ground.

At any point in the game, a maximum of 5 coins can be present on the screen simultaneously and the monster will always be shown on the screen.

The game begins when the spacebar is pressed, spawning the character on the left side of the screen on the ground and generating coins randomly across the screen with having to be above the ground and monster around the middle of the screen in front of the character. The character automatically starts moving horizontally at a velocity, and the player controls its upward vertical movement by pressing spacebar to make the character jump or holding the ‘w’ key to make it fly. As the character reaches the right edge of the screen, the character reappears on the left side, maintaining its continuous motion. The game-playing area is bounded vertically by the top of the screen and the ground.
